# TiNy

TiNy is CLI wrapper for the official [Titanium](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference), [Alloy](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_Command-Line_Interface_Reference) and related CLI's to make the world a better place by minimizing the amount of keyboard strokes per common task.

## Quick Start

### Install from NPM
TiNy is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js installed you can use the included NPM package manager to install [TiNy](https://npmjs.org/package/tn) via the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g tn
```

### Build an app
The default options for TiNy are set to execute `ti build` for iOS. So even without passing any argument, TiNy will build your app for iOS and launch it in the simulator:

```
$ tn
TiNy by Fokke Zandbergen <www.fokkezb.nl>
The simple CLI for Titanium, Alloy and related tools.

[INFO] Executing: ti build -p ios
...
```

Another example bulding an app for the App Store:

```
$ tn appstore 37304C9F-B2E0-490A-9800-0448A33BECE9 "Fokke Zandbergen (E8978765FC)"
```

Or using custom [recipes](#recipes):

```
$ tn myapp: 37304C9F-B2E0-490A-9800-0448A33BECE9
$ tn me: "Fokke Zandbergen (E8978765FC)"
$ tn shipit: appstore myapp me

$ tn shipit
```

## Arguments

### System arguments
Some arguments have to do with how TiNy works:

Argument(s) | Description
----------- | -----------
`v`, `version`, `-v` | Prints TiNy version. Must be first argument.
`recipes` | Prints system and user(overridden) recipes. Must be first argument.
`debug` | Doesn't execute final command, only prints it.
`[a-z]+:` | Sets or unsets an recipe, see [Recipes](#recipes).

### Smart arguments
The best way to keep TiNy tiny is to guess the key by its value and to understand the relationship between arguments:

Argument | Param | Comments
-------- | ----- | --------
`android`, `ios`, `tizen`, `blackberry`, `mobileweb` | `-p [arg]` | Sets the platform. For `blackberry` it also defaults `-O ~/Desktop`.
`simulator`, `device`, `distribute`, `dist-playstore`, `dist-appstore`, `dist-adhoc` | `-T [arg]` | Sets the target and - if it's platform-specific - the platform. For `dist-playstore` and `dist-adhoc` it also defaults `-O ~/Desktop`.
`iphone`, `ipad`, `universal` | `-F [arg] -p ios` | Sets the device family, but also platform to `ios`
3.1.3.GA | `-s [arg]` | Sets the SDK version
37304C9F-B2E0-490A-9800-0448A33BECE9 | `-P [arg] -p ios` | Sets the provisioning profile UUID, but also platform to `ios`
Fokke Zandbergen `(`E8978765FC`)` | `-R/V [arg]` | Sets the developer or distribution certificate name, depending on target. Also sets platform to `ios`.
/path/to/my`.keystore` | `-K [arg]`| Sets the keystore, but also platform to `android`
/just/some`/`path | `-O [arg]` | Sets the output path, but only if an earlier argument has set the platform to `blackberry` or the target to `dist-playstore` or `dist-adhoc`

### Param arguments
If there's no smart argument for what you need, you can set any param on the executed command directly by using various available key-value notation styles:

```
$ tn -R "Fokke Zandbergen"
$ tn R="Fokke Zandbergen"
$ tn R:"Fokke Zandbergen"
$ tn --distribution-name FokkeZB
$ tn distribution-name=FokkeZB
$ tn distribution-name:FokkeZB
$ tn -retina
$ tn --retina
```

I prefer the `K=value` style since it takes the least keystrokes :)

## Recipes
Recipes are arguments that stand for one or more other arguments. By defining custom recipes you could build a certain app for the App Store by simply calling:

```
$ tn shipit
```

### Built-in system recipes
TiNy comes with a growing number of built-in recipes:

Recipe | Argument(s)
------ | -----------
`appstore` | `dist-appstore`
`playstore` | `dist-playstore`
`play` | `dist-playstore`
`dist` | `distribution`
`adhoc` | `dist-adhoc`
`desktop` | `~/Desktop`
`iphone7` | `S=7.0 Y=iphone`
`iphone6` | `S=6.1 Y=iphone`
`ipad7` | `S=7.0 Y=ipad`
`ipad6` | `S=6.1 Y=ipad`

### Custom user recipes
You can create a user recipes for one or combination of arguments by stating the name of the recipes as the first argument, followed by `:`. The following example lets you use `tn poop` to build an app for Google Play:

```
$ tn key: play ~/dev/.keystore
$ tn me: L=fokke
$ tn pass: P=iloveti
$ tn poop: pass me key
```

The user recipes are stored in `~/.tn.json`.

#### Loops
As you can see recipes can also use other recipes. Whenever you use an recipes, TiNy automagically prevents you from getting into a loop.

#### Overriding built-ins
You can also use the name of a system recipes for your custom one. This lets you override the built-in recipes. To restore, simply unset your custom recipes.

## Roadmap

* Rewrite mapping of arguments to options/params internally.
* Support more `ti` commands and the `alloy` CLI as well.
* Support combining commands: `tn compile run` (compile Alloy and run TiShadow)
* Add more smart arguments.
* Add more built-in recipes.
* Come up with more crappy Android recipes :)
